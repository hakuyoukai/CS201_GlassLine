CONVEYOR FAMILY DOCUMENTATION:

For conveyor family 5;

The way this conveyor family works is that it assumes the following setup:

Sensor -> conveyor -> pre-popup sensor -> popup -> workstations -> next conveyor

When a message is sent to the family, the family will message the first sensor, and the sensor will pass the item to the conveyor, and then to the popup.
The popup will then send the class to the appropriate workstation. The workstation returns the item to the popup, and passes it to the next conveyor family.

The offline conveyors concern conveyor familys 5,6 and 7, corresponding to "DRILL", "CROSS_SEAMER", and "GRINDER".
